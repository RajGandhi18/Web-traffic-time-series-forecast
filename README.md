# Time Series Prediction

## Project objective
The purpose of this project is to analyse time series data and predict the future time series variable in the data.

## Description

The first step of the analysis is to plot the data and obtain simple descriptive measures, such as plotting data, looking for trends,  seasonal fluctuations and so on. 
Visualizing the time series makes possible the presence of turning points where the upward trend suddenly changed to a downward trend. 
If there is a turning point, different models may have to be fitted to the two parts of the series.

A Statistical test is done to check if the data is stationary or not. Augmented Dicket-Fuller test is used to check for stationarity. If the data is not stationary then the data is transformed by scaling.
After the transformation various types of models are used for prediction such as AR, ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM and XGBoost.

This dataset is taken from kaggle which contains about 145k time series data.
